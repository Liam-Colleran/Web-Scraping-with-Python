**Simple Webscraping Application üëæ**

This is my first expierience working with webscraping.
I wanted to learn some webscraping for fun so I followed the full
freeCodeCamp.org crash course on youtube. All code here was manually written,
although I followed along with the video, nothing here was copy and pasted.

10/10 Highly recommend the video for anyone looking for an intro to webscraping. üëç

**Part 1:**
Part1.py opens the given .html file (home.html) and finds the course name and course price.

**Part 2:**
Part2.py takes a link (timesjobs.com) and filters out all the job posts that arnt listed as 'posted a few days ago'. 
It then finds the company name and required skills of the remaining job posts.

**Part 3:**
Part3.py is mostly the same as part2.py but has some added features. 1: You can choose to eliminate job postings that require
certain skills. 2: A link is provided to the job page of every job posting. 3: The output is saved to a .txt file located in the posts
folder. 4: Once the code is run it starts a timer to run every 10 minutes.
